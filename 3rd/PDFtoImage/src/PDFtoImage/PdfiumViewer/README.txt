For this project the original source code was stripped down:
All references to WinForms were removed and only rendering relevant methods were left.
The project type was changed to .NET Standard 2.0 and System.Drawing.Common from NuGet.org is used.
Also minor changes were made for supporting nullable reference types in C# 8.0.
