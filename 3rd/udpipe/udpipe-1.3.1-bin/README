UDPipe 1
========

UDPipe is a trainable pipeline for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization and
dependency parsing of CoNLL-U files. UDPipe is language-agnostic and can be
trained given annotated data in CoNLL-U format
(http://universaldependencies.org/format.html). Trained models are provided for
nearly all UD treebanks (http://universaldependencies.org). UDPipe is available
as a binary for Linux/Windows/OS X, as a library for C++, Python, Perl, Java,
C#, and as a web service. Third-party R CRAN package
(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=udpipe) also exists.

UDPipe is a free software distributed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0

non-commercial use and distributed under the CC BY-NC-SA
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license, although for some
models the original data used to create the model may impose additional
licensing conditions. UDPipe is versioned using Semantic Versioning
